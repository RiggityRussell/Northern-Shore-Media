        <div2><p>As owner and managing director of NSM, it's important to me that you have confidence in our desire and ability to help you grow your business.</p>
            <p>My 12+ years in account and campaign management, media planning, display advertising, and analytics have proven beneficial in the SMM arena. 
                You could say I've been trained to visually tell a story in small spaces - like a post!</p>
                <p>I've learned that everyone has a story to tell and it's important to listen to that story. To understand the company, the brand, to identify the relevant audience
                    and select the appropriate platform, and to promote the client, product or service in the best possible light.
                </p>
                <p>From day one, that has been my driving force. And that's what I'd like to do for you!</p>
